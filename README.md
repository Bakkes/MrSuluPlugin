# MrSuluPlugin
BakkesMod plugin for RocketLeague

This plugin will display (in the console, press F6) the time elapsed of your rides to hit the world, or hit the ball or score. Can be enabled in freeplay and custom trainings. Very handy to train being as fast as possible (fast aerials, drive without boost, ...).

Compile the plugin as a 32 bit dll with bakkesmodsdk ( instructions http://bakkesmod.com/sdk.php )
If you don't want to compile it, there's a dll available in /Release directory.

Put the dll in bakkesmod plugins directory, put the MrSuluPlugin.set file in plugins/settings directory.

Modify the in your RL / Bakkesmod installation the cfg/plugins.cfg to load MrSuluPlugin.
